<br />

During my 10 week internship with [gardeners.com](https://www.gardeners.com), I created this full stack web app from scratch. The front-end was built using *React*, paired with an *Express* back-end running on *Node*. Stored and managed data in Azureâ€™s *CosmosDB*. Constructed a pipeline in *YAML* to build and deploy the application from a *DevOps repository* to an *Azure Web App*. 

This was a solo project, so I was responsible for
* Requirements gathering
* UI & UX design
* Front-end development
* Back-end development
* Database design
* Deployment

This was a very challenging project for me. Since it was a solo project from scratch, they allowed me to use any stack as long as it could run as an Azure Web App. Seeing as I had never done a larger scale web development project before, I choose a very popular stack as I knew there would be plenty of online resources to guide me. Learning all of these new technologies on my own while trying to complete this project in under 10 weeks was stressful, but overall I'm incredibly grateful for the experience. I learned a ton, and I had a great summer working at Gardeners.
